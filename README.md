WeJapa Backend PHP Week 1 Task

## Contributing (adding your work/code) to this repo 
a 5 minute read

## Getting started:

Make sure you are on a desktop or laptop, and signed in to Github

**Step 1**: Click on Fork at the top right corner

**Step 2**: Click on clone or download, copy the url you see after clicking on it

**Step 3**: Head to your local machine and create a folder, (this step is not necessary but to keep your work organized on your local machine, you can create folder called ‘wejapa repo’ on your desktop).

**Step 4**: Open your preferred terminal

Here you an have array of choices, you could use git bash (you have to download it to use it. Download here -> [GitHub](https://git-scm.com/downloads)), powershell or your default window/mac terminal.

(**If you want to use git bash**) **4.1** Open the ‘wejapa repo’ folder, (if you created the folder remember you saved it on your desktop) or wherever you want this local repo to exist.
Right-click anywhere in the folder and choose ‘git bash here’, automatically git bash will open.

(**If you want to use the terminal**)
**4.2** Press Windows key on your keyboard and start typing "cmd" in the search bar, hit enter when the Command Prompt returns as result. on Mac, Press Cmd + Space to open spotlight search, and type terminal and hit return.

**Step 5**:`git clone pasteTheUrlOfTheLinkYouCopiedInStep2`

It should look like this
`git clone https://github.com/[yourGithubUsername]/wejapa-backend-php-wk-1.git`

**Step 6**: To start your work, walk into the directory that contains the project files.
`cd wejapa-backend-php-wk-1`

**Step 7**: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/oyedotunsodiq045/wejapa-backend-php-wk-1.git`

**Step 8**: `git pull upstream`

**Note**: you will be on the develop branch automatically.
You need to move to your personal branch to start your work. Because you are awesome :). I'm serious, you need to.

To move to another branch

Run: `git checkout -b <nameOfBranch>`

You can use any name for your branch.
(But for consistency and orderliness, use your slack username)

IE: <nameOfBranch> above should be replaced with your slack username, use hypen where you will normally use space. This implies if you have space(" ") in your username, use hypen("-")

For example,   
`git checkout -b peter-parker ✅`   
`git checkout -b peter parker ❌`

**Step 9**: Create a folder for your work...
`mkdir <nameOfFolder>`
    
You can use any name for your folder.
(But for consistency and orderliness, use your slack username)
    
... and walk into it
`cd <nameOfFolder>`

**Step 10**:    Open the project file with your favourite code editor (Sublime, VSCode, Atom, etc etc).
Navigate to the folder you created in Step 9 above and start being awesome!

Once you are done with your work and you have tested that everything works perfectly.

Run: `git add .` (take note of the dot)

Run: `git commit -m "add: <slackUsername> form"`    
`git push origin <nameOfBranch>`

For example, it would be
    
git push origin peter-parker - (Notice how it ends with the branch you created earlier - Step 8).
